# Simple-Blockchain
A simple Java application that implements a basic blockchain along with proof-of-work (mining) system developed with the help of Medium articles.  

A blockchain is simply a chain of blocks which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Any changes to these blocks will modify the signature and break the chain. The blockchain also requires proof-of-work mining to validate the blocks. All of these features are achieved in the noobchain Java application.
